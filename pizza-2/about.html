                    <h2>My Beginning</h2>
                    <p>I've got an interesting story you see. I would make pizza for myself every Friday. I called it
                        pizza Friday.
                        It was amazing! My first couple pizzas were not very good. But with some time and practice I
                        actually got
                        quite good. Well, one day I started showing some of my friends what great pizza I could make.

                    <h2>My Friends</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">My Friends loved my pizza so much that they said I should open up
                        my own restaurant! At first I
                        was pretty skeptical. A restaurant? Me? I don't know, that seems like a lot of work!
                    </p>
                    <p>Over time, as I kept making my pizzas every friday I couldn't shake the possibility from my mind.
                        "Maybe it could work!" I would think.

                    <h2>My Growth</h2>
                    <p>In the end I decided I would experiment with the idea of selling my pizza. I would go to local
                        hot spots with lots of foot traffic and offer my pizza for a dollar a slice. Suprisingly, my
                        pizza was a hit! The people could not have enough of it!

                    <h2>My Restaurant</h2>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Well, one thing led to another and BOOM! I went all in! I gathered
                        all of my life savings together to create my very own pizza restaurant. After leasing out
                        restaurant space, word got around on what I was doing. Some of my fans who had tried my pizza
                        found out I was opening up my own place and started spreading rumors like wild fire.
                    </p>
                    <p>The day I opened up shop so many people came to try out my pizza! Wow, it was such an exciting
                        day!
